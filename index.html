		<h1>How to plan a trip to the backcountry</h1>
			
			<div class="sect">
			<h2> Overview </h2>
			<p>The backcountry is a place of adventure. The uncertainty of mother nature 
			makes each trip unique and nothing ever goes as planned. Trips require a loose 
			agenda to navigate these challenges. The trip planning is really just
			studying an area enough so that you can comfortably improvise through it. <br>
			<br>
			This webpage provides a general outline of how to plan a trip to the backcountry.
			It focuses on providing tips and resources to get to scenic and remote places,
			while keeping in mind how the trip planning affects the trip experience. The
			philosophy behind this is that too much planning can spoil aspects of trips
			that are better experienced naturally. On the other hand, too little planning
			can result in unsafe and disappointing trips. <br>
			<br>
			The more experience you have trip planning, the better you will get at it. That
			does not necessarily mean your trips will be more enjoyable. The mishaps of 
			your first backcountry trips will forever hold as some of the best. To seek the
			same feeling of adventure, your trip plans will become increasingly crazy. You
			will explore places you never would have imagined. Your connection with nature
			will grow and the simple thought of a campfire will bring tears to your eyes. <br>

			<h2>Preliminary questions</h2>
				<p>Listed below are some initial questions that need to be answered when
				planning a trip. The priority of the questions is determined by you.
					<ul>
						<li> When is the trip? Where will the weather allow you to go? Is it 
						a crowded time of year?</li>
						<li> Who is going? Where are they located? What is their experience
						level? </li>
						<li> Who is driving? What type of car are they driving? How far do they
						want to drive? </li>
						<li> What type of trip is it? What are your priorities? </li>
						<li> How long are you going for? </li>
					</ul>
				</p>

			<h2>Maps</h2>
				<p> Maps are your main resource when determining the location and plan of a 
				trip. They provide the geographical information that lures you to a specific
				spot. Listed below are some important maps that can be used when planning a trip.
					<ul>
						<li><b> Physical topographic maps </b></li><br>
						These are the most important maps of all. They are what you will bring on
						your exploration. They provide a refreshing zoomed out view when compared to
						a computer based map and also tend to be loaded with the most important 
						infomation. With some experience, one can easily plan and incredible trip with
						just a paper topo map.<br><br>
						
						<li><b> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.google.com/maps"> Google maps</a></b> </li><br>
						Use the topographic and satellite view options. Scroll around looking for 
						terrain that suits your interests. Listed below are examples of things to look
						for when scrolling Google maps,<br><br>
							<ul>
								<li>Changes in topography</li>
								<li>Changes in terrain color</li>
								<li>Water features</li>
								<li>Remote roads, trails, trailheads, campgrounds</li>
								<li>Backcountry campspots</li>
									<ul>
										<li>When planning car camping trips, it can be nice to use 
										satellite view to check if a road has pull-offs to camp at. A
										good campspot often dictates the chosen location of a car camping
										trip. Its pretty easy to spot pullouts from satellite mode, so
										don't be suprised if someone is already perched in your chosen
										desination. Have backup plans and rememember the cuttiest spots
										are those that cannot be pointed out on a map.</li>
										<li>When planning backpacking trips, it is usualy not worth your
										time to identify campsites ahead of time.</li>
									</ul>
								<li>Other types of terrain that suit your interests - fishy spots, bike 
								trails, boating routes, ect.</li>	
							</ul><br>		
						Additionally, Google Maps is the best software to calculate drive times on 
						paved roads. Dirt road times are often calculated poorly. Calculate these times
						on your own and remember that the dirt road is usually part of the enjoyment of
						the trip.<br><br>

						<li><b>Public land maps</b></li><br>
						The <a target="_blank" href="https://blm-egis.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=6f0da4c7931440a8a80bfe20eddd7550">
						BLM</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://maps.usgs.gov/padus/">USGS Protected
						Areas Database of the United States</a> maps provide boundaries to public lands. 
						These are typically the boundaries that you will keep your recreation within. Changing
						the layers of these maps can be beneficial. These maps are not always exactly
						correct. Some mapping softwares claim to have exact up-to-date boundaries.<br>
						<br>
						Check a public land map even when your trip seems to be 100% in public land.
						Often times, there are small parcels of private land within a public land plot.
						Paper topographic maps always include public land boundaries. <br><br>
						
						<li><b>Online mapping softwares</b></li><br>
						These are online maps that allow you to draw a trip route on a map. The 
						software returns an interactive milage and elevation profile of the route. <br>
						<br>
						<a target="_blank" href="https://www.gaiagps.com/"> Gaia GPS</a> is one of the best free online
						mapping softwares. The Gaia Topo map layer is a great map that makes trails and
						roads easy to spot. The USGS topo layer should always be checked to see if the
						Gaia Topo layer is missing any information. The calculated elevation profiles
						sometimes can be questionable. 
						<a target="_blank" href="https://caltopo.com/map.html"> CalTopo</a> is a similar mapping software.<br>
						<br>
						
						<li><b> Other maps </b></li>
							<ul>
								<li> Wildfire history map </li>
								<li> Waterfall map </li>
								<li> Fishing maps (dave's, south sierra fish) </li>
								<li> Hot springs map </li>
								<li> Trail conditions </li>
								<li> Near real time satelite </li>
							</ul>	
						</ul>

			<h2> Guidebooks </h2>
			<p> Guidebooks go beyond maps by providing written descriptions of routes and places. They
			are far more useful than what you find searching the internet. Guidebooks are written by
			experts that have fully explored the area you are researching, thus, can give trustworthy
			opinions on where is best to go. They give you tons of trip options and are formatted so
			that you can easily compare trips. They also usually give little photos of the area, for 
			the better. Used book sites like <a target="_blank" href="https://www.thriftbooks.com/"> Thriftbooks</a> are
			the best place to buy cheap guidebooks online. Purchase guidebooks covering areas and
			activities you want to research. Target the most up to date version of the guidebook you 
			desire. See photo below for examples of good guidebooks.</p>
			</div>

			<h2> Online rescources </h2>
			<p>The best online rescources are databases formatted similar to guidebooks. Trip report 
			blogs can also provide great trip ideas and inspiration. However, these reports typically 
			provide an unnecessary amount of information, photos, and videos. Your time is better spent
			exploring nature than scrolling through peoples camera roll.</p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="sect">
			<h2>Rules and regulations</h2>
			<p> Knowing the rules and regulations of an area is a key part of trip planning. This 
			information is best obtained on the website of whomever enforces the rules of the area.
			Rules change with time, so look for the most up to date info in regards to them. Calling 
			the ranger station is always a good idea. Rules are sometimes so hard to distinguish that
			you don't know them until your at your destination staring at a sign or talking to a ranger.
			Below is a list of common regulations to research before a trip. 
			<ul>
				<li> Backpacking permits <br>
				<br>
				Many public lands limit the number of vistors to an area by using quotas. A quota is
				the number of people that can depart from a trailhead each day. A permit system is used 
				to enforce the quotas. Learning the permit system is key to sucessfully obtaining the
				permit you want. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.recreation.gov/"> Recreation.gov</a> is the main 
				website used for permit reservations. Typically, a portion of a trailhead's permits
				are made available online 6 months in advance, while the rest are made available closer
				to the start date of the trip. Often times permits must be obtained at the exact time they 
				are made available. For your best chances at these permits, practice obtaining permits
				ahead of time for a start date prior to the start date you want. Cancel the reservation 
				at the checkout window if the practice round was a success. If no permits are availble,
				remember backcountry permits apply only to your departure location. You can usually use
				a less popular trailhead to get where you want, it will just take more time. <br>
				<br>
				Backcountry trips are often times last minute endevours. This allows you to more accurately
				plan around mother nature (i.e. weather, snowmelt, wildfires). Permits cannot always be 
				obtained last minute, especially if you have a large group size. Many public lands do not
				require backpacking permits. Naive hikers assume these areas are less desirable. These
				places do not require permits because they are not overpopulated. Do not let permits
				dissuade you from going on a backcountry trip. </li> <br>
				<li> Fishing regulations </li>
				<li> Campfire regulations </li>
				<li> Trail and road regulations </li>

			<h2> Trail and road conditions</h2>
			<p> Trail and road conditions change with time. Contact the ranger station and others who know
			the area to ensure your desired trail or road is open and passable. Know your abilities and 
			always have a backup plan. The uncertainty of backcountry conditions makes the trip an adventure.</p>
